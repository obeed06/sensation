		<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
		<br>
		<p><strong>SENSATION</strong> <cite class="infusion-styling">Infusion</cite> was brought to life from a passion of cocktail making and home brewing.</p> 
		<p>Time and again the cocktail book would be opened up to make a weird and wonderful cocktail to find that so many recipes required an ingredient that couldn't be found on the shelf. The spirit infusions began as a hobby to bring alive a love for cocktail making. The aim of this business is to enable people to make a diverse array of wonderful concoctions at home or to make a special event more memorable with an unusual cocktail.</p>
		<h3>Amanda</h3>
		<p>Originally I stuck to making infusions with well known recipes and flavours, but the more I did it the more adventurous I got with combining different flavours. Working in flavour chemistry helped my understanding of how flavours are layered up to compliment each other and before long I was making weird and wonderful concoctions for the Christmas party. seeing how people loved to try something new it soon became a regular hobby and now I have a reputation for my infusion making.</p>  
		<h3>James</h3> 
		<p>I have always had an interest in the flavour of food and drink, that has led me to spend the last 6 years working in food chemistry. I have also indulged in learning as much as possible from cooking shows as I love to cook in my spare time. My interest in home brew started quite early as I used to love helping my dad out with anything he was doing.  So from a young age I was helping out making wines and beers, and understanding the process behind it.  As I have got older, I have branched out to make the products I love to drink on a night out.  I think it is hard to beat a refreshing gingerbeer or glass of honey mead after a long days work.  I have always enjoyed a cocktail or two, but only ever experienced the commercial ones available in mainstream pubs.  After becoming friends with Amanda, I have been introduced into a whole new world of cocktails and I haven't looked back!  This business started after a few conversations about how much we enjoyed our hobbies and that it would be nice to do as a job.  We decided to try and make that a reality and Sensation Infusion was born!</p>
